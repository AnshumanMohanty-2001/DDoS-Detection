# DDoS-Detection
With the increase in technological advancement, especially the internet, there 
come various kinds of network attacks. DOS attacks pose one of the most 
challenging security threats in todayâ€™s generation of internet. In addition, the 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are of a particular concern whose 
impact can be proportionally severe. The challenging part of this attack is that it 
comes with little or no advance warning and could easily exhaust away the 
communication or computation resources of the victim in a short span of time. 
These attacks are becoming advanced day-by-day and are increasing in number 
thus making it difficult to detect and counter such attacks. In this project, 
numerous types of DDoS attacks such as Ping Flood Attack, Syn Flood attack, 
UDP attack, Ping of Death, Slowloris, NTP amplification, HTTP flood, Smurf 
attack etc. are implemented. In addition to detecting the upsurge of packets during 
DDoS attack using Wireshark, we would be incorporating Machine Learning 
techniques for effective detection of DDoS flooding attack such as K-Nearest 
Neighbors, C.4.5, Multi-layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, 
Support Vector Machine etc. A detailed comparative analysis of the 
aforementioned algorithms is performed and is evaluated based on the accuracy 
metrics.
